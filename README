#Sparse Tensor Storage Project

The purpose of this application is to allow users to read and import data, which will be stored using Alto and Hicoo. Hicoo is a form of hierarchial storage. It will condense the sparse tensors down into ones and zeros that wil be retrieved as coordinates. Then it will partition those values and coordinates into blocks, which are stored into a multidimensional array for fast retrieval. While Alto is a adaptive linearized storage format for sparse tensors. It will generate linearized indexs that map nonzero values of the high dimensional matrix. Users will be able to choose if they want to store data as double, int, or float. The application will utilize these python modules and libraries, os and numpy.
